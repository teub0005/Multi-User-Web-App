			<p class="mb-5"><h4>Bio</h4><p>My name is Noah Beer and I am a sophomore at the University of St. Thomas. I am persuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Entrepreneurship. Depending on my interest in Stats 320, I may also add a Statistics minor. I grew up in Prior Lake, MN where I attended Prior Lake High School. I have played hockey my whole life and it is my favorite sport. I enjoy watching the NFL, NHL, and NBA. I am a die hard Vikings and Wild fan. Outside of sports, I love boating, wakesurfing, wakeboarding, fishing, and country music festivals, specifically WeFest. Upon completion of my degree, I plan to develop my skills as a programmer at a local company for 5-10 years until I take my chance in starting my own business, selling it for big bucks, and retiring young</p>

It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features"(Wikipedia). We used github to host our project. We kept all of our files on there as a way to easily update each other.</dd>
